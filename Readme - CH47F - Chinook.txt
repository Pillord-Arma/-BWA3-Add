Class Names
------------

• kyo_MH47E_base - Standard MH-47E.

  * The Normal version is same as the 'Hardcore' version but with the get out positions on the outside of the Chinook so the AI aren't stuck inside it.

• kyo_MH47E_Ramp - MH-47E with Fixed Ramp.
  
  * The Fixed Ramp version of the MH-47E has the ramp fixed at the 'Level Ramp' position as there is extra spaces on the ramp for 2 men to sit on the 
    edge of the ramp.

• kyo_MH47E_HC - The 'HardCore' Version.

  * The 'Hardcore' version is strictly for Multiplayer really (Intended to anyway). As all the get out positions are inside the Chinook, so therefor you
    can exit the chopper and run out the ramp on a cliff extraction or sea extraction etc.

• kyo_CH47_HC3 - RAF CH-47 HC.3.

  * RAF version of the CH-47 HC.3 Chinook.
